# Botomy Python Bot

This repository is my humble shrine to bad decisions, questionable logic, and the timeless struggle of a programmer attempting to gaslight himself into believing he's a **Pythonista** and, eventually, make Python do what I want *on purpose*. It begins as a simple attempt to build a Botomy bot using Python and an API. It will almost certainly evolve into a slowly expanding archive of "features" (a polite way of saying demented attempts) that psychologists may one day interpret as an early warning sign of my impending mental decline.

## About the Game
If you'd like to see the digital arena where my bot makes its poor life choices, you can find the game here:
> [Botomy](https://botomy.com/)

## Project Purpose

This is not a polished showcase. This is a survival log.

It exists so I can:
* Communicate with the Botomy API without immediately catastrophic results
* Parse and interpret game state while pretending I understand any of it
* Make movement and combat decisions that sometimes resemble intent
* Iteratively improve the bot as I descend deeper into the documentation—and the abyss

At this infant stage, the bot behaves like a confused Roomba with anger issues. Its priorities are unclear, its targeting is bad, and its sense of direction is—charitably—experimental.

But the plan is to refine this chaos into something resembling a strategy and not something pasted together from a tutorial...

Someday...

**Maybe**.....

## Current Status

The bot currently:

* Connects to the game (usually)
* Receives game state (when it feels like it)
* Responds with extremely rudimentary logic (blame me, not the game):
  * The bot runs at enemies swinging a sword (hoping to connect)
  * The bot also runs toward shiny things like a magpie (which are immeasurably more intelligent and graceful)

Targeting accuracy is subpar. Threat assessment is nonexistent. Decision-making is experimental. Everything else is duct tape, hubris, and the faint whisper of hope.

## Roadmap

### Short-Term

* **Get gooder**
* Learn to determine whether an item or an enemy is closer without summoning cosmic dread
* Check distance before attacking instead of blindly running at enemies like a medieval peasant waving a sword and hoping for the best
* Add heroic battlecries (for the bot's morale, not its effectiveness)
* Pretend to understand abstractions

### Long-Term

* Make everything more sophisticated
* Improve logic so the bot stops operating at my intellectual level
* Add sophisticated yet heroic battlecries (to inspire fellow comrades)
* Eventually upgrade from "sentient rock" to "confused intern"

## Licensing and Attribution
This project is based on the **Botomy Python Starter** project:
> [FastAPI Project Starter](https://github.com/botomy/botomy-python-starter)

The original project uses the MIT License, which is permissive enough to allow copying, modification, and redistribution. This repository continues under the MIT License for compatibility and to ensure that others may one day build upon (or mercifully fix) what I have created.

If you're reading this early version, please assume every bug, mistake, and **mispselling** is entirely unintentional and the result of my ongoing battle with both Python and my own questionable life choices. Thank you!
